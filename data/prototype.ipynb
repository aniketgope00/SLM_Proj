It involves training a model using labeled data, where each input comes with a corresponding correct output. The process is like a teacher guiding a student—hence the term “supervised” learning. In this article, we’ll explore the key components of supervised learning, the different types of supervised machine learning algorithms used, and some practical examples of how it works.\\n\\n![supervised-machine-learning](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241022160725494723/supervised-machine-learning.webp)\\n\\nSupervised Machine Learning\\n\\n## What is Supervised Machine Learning?\\n\\nAs we explained before, **supervised learning** is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data—meaning each input is paired with the correct output. the model learns by comparing its predictions with the actual answers provided in the training data. Over time, it adjusts itself to minimize errors and improve accuracy. The goal of supervised learning is to make accurate predictions when given new, unseen data. For example, if a model is trained to recognize handwritten digits, it will use what it learned to correctly identify new numbers it hasn’t seen before.\\n\\nSupervised learning can be applied in various forms, includingsupervised learning classification and supervised learning regression, making it a crucial technique in the field of artificial intelligence and supervised data mining.\\n\\nA fundamental concept in supervised machine learning is learning a class from examples. This involves providing the model with examples where the correct label is known, such as learning to classify images of cats and dogs by being shown labeled examples of both. The model then learns the distinguishing features of each class and applies this knowledge to classify new images.\\n\\n## **How Supervised Machine Learning Works?**\\n\\nWhere **supervised learning algorithm** consists of input features and corresponding output labels. The process works through:\\n\\n- **Training Data:** The model is provided with a training dataset that includes input data (features) and corresponding output data (labels or target variables).\\n- **Learning Process:** The algorithm processes the training data, learning the relationships between the input features and the output labels. This is achieved by adjusting the model’s parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual labels.\\n\\nAfter training, the model is evaluated using a [test dataset](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-test-dataset-in-machine-learning/) to measure its accuracy and performance. Then the model’s performance is optimized by adjusting parameters and using techniques like [cross-validation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cross-validation-machine-learning/) to [balance bias and variance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-bias-variance-trade-off/). This ensures the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.\\n\\n_**In summary, supervised machine learning involves training a model on labeled data to learn patterns and relationships, which it then uses to make accurate predictions on new data.**_\\n\\nLet’s learn how a supervised machine learning model is trained on a dataset to learn a mapping function between input and output, and then with learned function is used to make predictions on new data:\\n\\n![training_testing](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230822183232/training_testing.png)\\n\\nIn the image above,\\n\\n- **Training** phase involves feeding the algorithm labeled data, where each data point is paired with its correct output. The algorithm learns to identify patterns and relationships between the input and output data.\\n- **Testing** phase involves feeding the algorithm new, unseen data and evaluating its ability to predict the correct output based on the learned patterns.\\n\\n## **Types of Supervised Learning in Machine Learning**\\n\\nNow, Supervised learning can be applied to two main types of problems:\\n\\n- [Classification](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/getting-started-with-classification/): Where the output is a categorical variable (e.g., spam vs. non-spam emails, yes vs. no).\\n- [Regression](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/regression-in-machine-learning/): Where the output is a continuous variable (e.g., predicting house prices, stock prices).\\n\\n![types-of-SL](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230822183637/types-of-SL.png)\\n\\nWhile training the model, data is usually [split in the ratio of 80:20](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/splitting-data-for-machine-learning-models/) i.e. 80% as training data and the rest as testing data. In training data, we feed input as well as output for 80% of data. The model learns from training data only. We use different **supervised learning algorithms** (which we will discuss in detail in the next section) to build our model. Let’s first understand the classification and regression data through the table below:\\n\\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/supervised-data.png)\\n\\nBoth the above figures have labelled data set as follows:\\n\\n- **Figure A:** It is a dataset of a shopping store that is useful in predicting whether a customer will purchase a particular product under consideration or not based on his/ her gender, age, and salary.\\n\\n**Input:** Gender, Age, Salary\\n\\n**Output:** Purchased i.e. 0 or 1; 1 means yes the customer will purchase and 0 means that the customer won’t purchase it.\\n- **Figure B:** It is a Meteorological dataset that serves the purpose of predicting wind speed based on different parameters.\\n\\n**Input:** Dew Point, Temperature, Pressure, Relative Humidity, Wind Direction\\n\\n**Output:** Wind Speed\\n\\n> **Refer to this article for more information of** [**Types of Machine Learning**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-machine-learning/)\\n\\n## Practical Examples of Supervised learning\\n\\nFew practical examples of supervised machine learning across various industries:\\n\\n- [**Fraud Detection in Banking**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/online-payment-fraud-detection-using-machine-learning-in-python/) **:** Utilizes supervised learning algorithms on historical transaction data, training models with labeled datasets of legitimate and fraudulent transactions to accurately predict fraud patterns.\\n- [**Parkinson Disease Prediction:**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/parkinson-disease-prediction-using-machine-learning-python/?ref=lbp) Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system and the parts of the body controlled by the nerves.\\n- [**Customer Churn Prediction**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-customer-churn-analysis-prediction/) **:** Uses supervised learning techniques to analyze historical customer data, identifying features associated with churn rates to predict customer retention effectively.\\n- [**Cancer cell classification:**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-cancer-cell-classification-using-scikit-learn/?ref=lbp) Implements supervised learning for cancer cells based on their features, and identifying them if they are ‘malignant’ or ‘benign.\\n- [**Stock Price Prediction:**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stock-price-prediction-using-machine-learning-in-python/) Applies supervised learning to predict a signal that indicates whether buying a particular stock will be helpful or not.\\n\\n## **Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms**\\n\\n**Supervised learning** can be further divided into several different types, each with its own unique characteristics and applications. Here are some of the most common types of supervised learning algorithms:\\n\\n- [**Linear Regression**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-linear-regression/): Linear regression is a type of supervised learning regression algorithm that is used to predict a continuous output value. It is one of the simplest and most widely used algorithms in supervised learning.\\n- [**Logistic Regression**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-logistic-regression/): Logistic regression is a type of supervised learning classification algorithm that is used to predict a binary output variable.\\n- [**Decision Trees**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decision-tree/): Decision tree is a tree-like structure that is used to model decisions and their possible consequences. Each internal node in the tree represents a decision, while each leaf node represents a possible outcome.\\n- [**Random Forests**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/random-forest-regression-in-python/): Random forests again are made up of multiple decision trees that work together to make predictions. Each tree in the forest is trained on a different subset of the input features and data. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of all the trees in the forest.\\n- [**Support Vector Machine(SVM)**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/support-vector-machine-algorithm/) : The SVM algorithm creates a hyperplane to segregate n-dimensional space into classes and identify the correct category of new data points. The extreme cases that help create the hyperplane are called support vectors, hence the name Support Vector Machine.\\n- [**K-Nearest Neighbors**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-nearest-neighbours/) **(KNN) :** KNN works by finding k training examples closest to a given input and then predicts the class or value based on the majority class or average value of these neighbors. The performance of KNN can be influenced by the choice of k and the distance metric used to measure proximity.\\n- [**Gradient Boosting**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-gradient-boosting/): Gradient Boosting combines weak learners, like [decision trees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decision-tree/), to create a strong model. It iteratively builds new models that correct errors made by previous ones.\\n- [**Naive Bayes Algorithm**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/naive-bayes-classifiers/): The Naive Bayes algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm based on applying [Bayes’ Theorem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bayes-theorem/) with the “naive” assumption that features are independent of each other given the class label.\\n\\nLet’s summarize the **supervised machine learning algorithms** in table:\\n\\n| Algorithm | Regression,<br>Classification | Purpose | Method | Use Cases |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Linear Regression | Regression | Predict continuous output values | Linear equation minimizing sum of squares of residuals | Predicting continuous values |\\n| Logistic Regression | Classification | Predict binary output variable | Logistic function transforming linear relationship | Binary classification tasks |\\n| Decision Trees | Both | Model decisions and outcomes | Tree-like structure with decisions and outcomes | Classification and Regression tasks |\\n| Random Forests | Both | Improve classification and regression accuracy | Combining multiple decision trees | Reducing overfitting, improving prediction accuracy |\\n| SVM | Both | Create hyperplane for classification or predict continuous values | Maximizing margin between classes or predicting continuous values | Classification and Regression tasks |\\n| KNN | Both | Predict class or value based on k closest neighbors | Finding k closest neighbors and predicting based on majority or average | Classification and Regression tasks, sensitive to noisy data |\\n| Gradient Boosting | Both | Combine weak learners to create strong model | Iteratively correcting errors with new models | Classification and Regression tasks to improve prediction accuracy |\\n| Naive Bayes | Classification | Predict class based on feature independence assumption | Bayes’ theorem with feature independence assumption | Text classification, spam filtering, sentiment analysis, medical |\\n\\nThese **types of supervised learning in machine learning** vary based on the problem you’re trying to solve and the dataset you’re working with. In classification problems, the task is to assign inputs to predefined classes, while regression problems involve predicting numerical outcomes.\\n\\n## Training a Supervised Learning Model: Key Steps\\n\\nThe goal of Supervised learning is to generalize well to unseen data.

Clean the data, handle missing values, and scale features as needed to ensure high quality for **supervised learning** algorithms.\\n2. [**Splitting the Data**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/splitting-data-for-machine-learning-models/): Divide the data into [**training set** (80%) and the **test set** (20%)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/training-data-vs-testing-data/).\\n3. **Choosing the Model**: Select appropriate algorithms based on the problem type. This step is crucial for effective **supervised learning** in AI.\\n4. **Training the Model**: Feed the model input data and output labels, allowing it to learn patterns by adjusting internal parameters.\\n5. [**Evaluating the Model**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning-model-evaluation/): Test the trained model on the unseen test set and assess its performance using various metrics.\\n6. [**Hyperparameter Tuning**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hyperparameter-tuning/) **:** Adjust settings that control the training process (e.g., learning rate) using techniques like grid search and cross-validation.\\n7. **Final Model Selection and Testing**: Retrain the model on the complete dataset using the best hyperparameters testing its performance on the test set to ensure readiness for deployment.\\n8. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the validated model to make predictions on new, unseen data.\\n\\nBy following these steps, supervised learning models can be effectively trained to tackle various tasks, from **learning a class from examples** to making predictions in real-world applications.\\n\\n## A **dvantages and Disadvantages of Supervised Learning**\\n\\n### **Advantages of Supervised Learning**\\n\\nThe power of **supervised learning** lies in its ability to accurately predict patterns and make data-driven decisions across a variety of applications.

      "## What is Supervised Machine Learning?\n",
      "\n",
      "As we explained before, **supervised learning** is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data—meaning each input is paired with the correct output. the model learns by comparing its predictions with the actual answers provided in the training data. Over time, it adjusts itself to minimize errors and improve accuracy. The goal of supervised learning is to make accurate predictions when given new, unseen data. For example, if a model is trained to recognize handwritten digits, it will use what it learned to correctly identify new numbers it hasn’t seen before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Supervised learning can be applied in various forms, includingsupervised learning classification and supervised learning regression, making it a crucial technique in the field of artificial intelligence and supervised data mining.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fundamental concept in supervised machine learning is learning a class from examples. This involves providing the model with examples where the correct label is known, such as learning to classify images of cats and dogs by being shown labeled examples of both. The model then learns the distinguishing features of each class and applies this knowledge to classify new images.\n",
      "\n",
      "## **How Supervised Machine Learning Works?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Where **supervised learning algorithm** consists of input features and corresponding output labels. The process works through:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Training Data:** The model is provided with a training dataset that includes input data (features) and corresponding output data (labels or target variables).\n",
      "- **Learning Process:** The algorithm processes the training data, learning the relationships between the input features and the output labels. This is achieved by adjusting the model’s parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual labels.\n",
      "\n",
      "After training, the model is evaluated using a [test dataset](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-test-dataset-in-machine-learning/) to measure its accuracy and performance. Then the model’s performance is optimized by adjusting parameters and using techniques like [cross-validation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cross-validation-machine-learning/) to [balance bias and variance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-bias-variance-trade-off/). This ensures the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.\n",
      "\n",
      "_**In summary, supervised machine learning involves training a model on labeled data to learn patterns and relationships, which it then uses to make accurate predictions on new data.**_\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s learn how a supervised machine learning model is trained on a dataset to learn a mapping function between input and output, and then with learned function is used to make predictions on new data:\n",
      "\n",
      "![training_testing](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230822183232/training_testing.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "In the image above,\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Training** phase involves feeding the algorithm labeled data, where each data point is paired with its correct output. The algorithm learns to identify patterns and relationships between the input and output data.\n",
      "- **Testing** phase involves feeding the algorithm new, unseen data and evaluating its ability to predict the correct output based on the learned patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "## **Types of Supervised Learning in Machine Learning**\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Supervised learning can be applied to two main types of problems:\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Classification](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/getting-started-with-classification/): Where the output is a categorical variable (e.g., spam vs. non-spam emails, yes vs. no).\n",
      "- [Regression](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/regression-in-machine-learning/): Where the output is a continuous variable (e.g., predicting house prices, stock prices).\n",

      "\n",
      "While training the model, data is usually [split in the ratio of 80:20](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/splitting-data-for-machine-learning-models/) i.e. 80% as training data and the rest as testing data. In training data, we feed input as well as output for 80% of data. The model learns from training data only. We use different **supervised learning algorithms** (which we will discuss in detail in the next section) to build our model. Let’s first understand the classification and regression data through the table below:\n",
