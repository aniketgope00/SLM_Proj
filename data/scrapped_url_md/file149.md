## Components and Features of Hugging Face

In this section of the article, we will discuss about the core components and Features of Hugging face.

### **Transformers:**

Hugging Face Transformers is a well-liked package for PyTorch and TensorFlow-based natural language processing applications. Hugging Face Transformers offers pre-trained models for a range of natural language processing (NLP) activities, including translation, named entity identification, text categorization, and more. Using pretrained models will reduce your compute costs, carbon footprint, and save your time and resources required to train a model from scratch.

These models support common tasks in different modalities, such as:

- Natural Language Processing: [text classification](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rnn-for-text-classifications-in-nlp/), [named entity recognition](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/named-entity-recognition/), question answering, language modeling, summarization, translation, multiple choice, and text generation.
- Computer Vision: [image classification](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-image-classification-using-keras/), object detection, and segmentation.
- Audio: automatic speech recognition and audio classification.
- Multimodal: [optical character recognition](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-optical-character-recognition-ocr/), table question answering, information extraction from scanned documents, visual question answering, and video classification.

Transformers framework supports interoperability between [PyTorch](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/getting-started-with-pytorch/), [TensorFlow](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-tensorflow/), and JAX. This can provide the flexibility to use a different framework at each stage of a model’s life; train a model in three lines of code in one framework and load it for inference in another. Models can be exported in various format like [TorchScript](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-machine-learning-frameworks-in-2020/) and ONNX for deployment in production environments.

### **Tokenizers: Text Transformers**

In the world of [NLP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/natural-language-processing-overview/), tokenizers play a crucial role as they are like translators for machines. Their job is to turn text into a language that machine learning models can easily grasp. This is super important when dealing with different languages and types of text.

Think of tokenizers as language architects. They break down text into smaller chunks called tokens—these can be words, subwords, or characters. These tokens become the building blocks that help models understand and create human language.

But that's not all! Tokenizers also do some cool tricks. They turn these tokens into numbers that models can use, and they make sure all sequences are the same length by handling padding and truncation.

Hugging Face has a variety of user-friendly tokenizers designed especially for their Transformers library. It's like having the perfect tools for getting text ready before feeding it to the models. If you want to dive deeper into this language magic, there's more about [Tokenization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp-how-tokenizing-text-sentence-words-works/) in another article.

## Features offered by Hugging Face

### **Models:**

The Model Hub is like the cool hangout spot for the NLP community, where you can find thousands of models and datasets ready to roll. It's a neat feature that lets users share and discover models, making NLP development a team effort.
