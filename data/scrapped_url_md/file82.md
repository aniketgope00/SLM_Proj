# Gaussian Mixture Model

Clustering is a key technique in unsupervised learning, used to group similar data points together. While traditional methods like **K-Means** and **Hierarchical Clustering** are widely used, they assume that clusters are well-separated and have rigid shapes. This can be limiting in real-world scenarios where clusters can be more complex.

To overcome these limitations, **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** offer a more flexible approach. Unlike K-Means, which assigns each point to a single cluster, GMM uses a probabilistic approach to cluster the data, allowing clusters to have more varied shapes and soft boundaries. Let’s dive into what GMM is and how it works

## Gaussian Mixture Model vs K-Means

- A Gaussian mixture model is a **soft clustering technique** used in [unsupervised learning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unsupervised-learning/) to determine the probability that a given data point belongs to a cluster. It’s composed of several Gaussians, each identified by k ∈ {1,…, K}, where K is the number of clusters in a data set and is comprised of the following parameters.

- K-means is a clustering algorithm that assigns each data point to one cluster based on the closest centroid. It’s a **hard clustering** method, meaning each point belongs to only one cluster with no uncertainty.

On the other hand, **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** use **soft clustering**, where data points can belong to multiple clusters with a certain probability. This provides a more flexible and nuanced way to handle clusters, especially when points are close to multiple centroids.

## **How Gaussian Mixture Models Work?**

Now that we understand the key differences between K-Means and GMM, let’s dive deeper into how GMM actually works. Unlike K-Means, where the clustering process relies solely on the centroid and assigns each data point to one cluster, GMM uses a probabilistic approach. Here’s how GMM performs clustering:

1. **Multiple Gaussians (Clusters):** Each cluster is represented by a Gaussian distribution, and the data points are assigned probabilities of belonging to different clusters based on their distance from each Gaussian.
2. **Parameters of a Gaussian:** The core of GMM is made up of three main parameters for each Gaussian:
   - **Mean (μ):** The center of the Gaussian distribution.
   - **Covariance (Σ):** Describes the spread or shape of the cluster.
   - **Mixing Probability (π):** Determines how dominant or likely each cluster is in the data.

The Gaussian mixture model assigns a probability to each data point xnx\_nxn​ of belonging to a cluster. The probability of data point ​ coming from Gaussian cluster k is expressed as

\[Tex\]P(z\_n = k \\mid x\_n) = \\frac{\\pi\_k \\cdot \\mathcal{N}(x\_n \\mid \\mu\_k, \\Sigma\_k)}{\\sum\_{k=1}^{K} \\pi\_k \\cdot \\mathcal{N}(x\_n \\mid \\mu\_k, \\Sigma\_k)}\[/Tex\]

- where,
- \[Tex\]z\_n\[/Tex\]=k is a latent variable indicating which Gaussian the point belongs to.
- \[Tex\]\\pi\_k\[/Tex\] is the mixing probability of the k-th Gaussian.
- \[Tex\]\\mathcal{N}(x\_n \\mid \\mu\_k, \\Sigma\_k)
\[/Tex\]is the Gaussian distribution with mean μk\\mu\_kμk​ and covariance Σk


Next, we need to calculate the overall likelihood of observing a data point xnx\_nxn​ under all Gaussians. This is achieved by summing over all possible clusters (Gaussians) for each point:

\[Tex\]P(x\_n) = \\sum\_{k=1}^{K} \\pi\_k \\mathcal{N}(x\_n \\mid \\mu\_k, \\Sigma\_k)\[/Tex\]

- Where:
- \[Tex\]P(x\_n)\[/Tex\] is the overall likelihood of observing the data point \[Tex\]x\_n\[/Tex\]
- The sum accounts for all possible Gaussians k.

## The Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm

To fit a Gaussian Mixture Model to the data, we use the **Expectation-Maximization (EM)** algorithm, which is an iterative method that optimizes the parameters of the Gaussian distributions (mean, covariance, and mixing coefficients). It works in two main steps:

1. **Expectation Step (E-step)**:
   - In this step, the algorithm calculates the probability that each data point belongs to each cluster based on the current parameter estimates (mean, covariance, mixing coefficients).
2. **Maximization Step (M-step)**:
   - After estimating the probabilities, the algorithm updates the parameters (mean, covariance, and mixing coefficients) to better fit the data.

These two steps are repeated until the model converges, meaning the parameters no longer change significantly between iterations.

### How GMM Works

Here’s a simple breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization**: Start with initial guesses for the means, covariances, and mixing coefficients of each Gaussian distribution.
2. **E-step**: For each data point, calculate the probability of it belonging to each Gaussian distribution (cluster).
3. **M-step**: Update the parameters (means, covariances, mixing coefficients) using the probabilities calculated in the E-step.
4. **Repeat**: Continue alternating between the E-step and M-step until the log-likelihood of the data (a measure of how well the model fits the data) converges.

**Formula:**

\[Tex\]L(\\mu\_k, \\Sigma\_k, \\pi\_k) = \\prod\_{n=1}^{N} \\sum\_{k=1}^{K} \\pi\_k \\mathcal{N}(x\_n \\mid \\mu\_k, \\Sigma\_k)\[/Tex\]

The E-step computes the probabilities that each data point belongs to each Gaussian, while the M-step updates the parameters μk​, Σk ​, and πk based on these probabilities.

## Implementation of GMM in python

So far, we have discussed about the working of GMM. Let’s take a simple example using the **Iris dataset** and fit a Gaussian Mixture Model with 3 clusters (since we know there are 3 species of Iris).

1. **Dataset**: We use only two features: sepal length and sepal width.
2. **Fitting the Model**: We fit the data as a mixture of 3 Gaussians.
3. **Result**: The model assigns each data point to a cluster based on the probabilities. After convergence, the GMM model will have updated the parameters to best fit the data.

Python`
from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
# Load iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data[:, :2]  # using only sepal length and sepal width
# Fit GMM with 3 components (clusters)
gmm = GaussianMixture(n_components=3)
gmm.fit(X)
# Predict the labels (cluster assignments)
labels = gmm.predict(X)
# Plot the results
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=labels, cmap='viridis')
plt.xlabel('Sepal Length')
plt.ylabel('Sepal Width')
plt.title('Gaussian Mixture Model Clustering')
plt.show()
`

**Output:**

GMM Clustering

This scatter plot shows the result of clustering data using a **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**. The data points represent measurements of flower species based on **sepal length** and **sepal width**. The points are divided into three clusters, represented by different colors (yellow, purple, and teal), which indicate that GMM has identified three distinct groups within the data.

## Advantages of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

1. **Flexible Cluster Shapes**: Unlike K-Means, which assumes spherical clusters, GMM can model clusters with arbitrary shapes.
2. **Soft Assignment**: GMM assigns a probability for each data point to belong to each cluster, while K-Means assigns each point to exactly one cluster.
3. **Handles Overlapping Data**: GMM performs well when clusters overlap or have varying densities. Since it uses probability distributions, it can assign a point to multiple clusters with different probabilities

## Limitations of GMM

1. **Computational Complexity**: GMM tends to be computationally expensive, particularly with large datasets, as it requires iterative processes like the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters.

- **Choosing the Number of Clusters**: Like other clustering methods, GMM requires you to specify the number of clusters beforehand. However, methods like the **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)** and **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)** can help in selecting the optimal number of clusters based on the data

## Conclusion

Gaussian Mixture Models provide a flexible and powerful tool for clustering when data has more complex structures. By treating clustering as a probabilistic problem, GMM allows for clusters with varied shapes and soft boundaries, unlike traditional methods like K-Means. The **Expectation-Maximization** algorithm is used to iteratively refine the model’s parameters, making GMM a great choice for many real-world clustering problems.

**When should I use Gaussian mixture model?**

> Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) are used for clustering and density estimation in unsupervised learning, particularly when data comes from multiple normal distributions. It’s applied in areas like image segmentation, market segmentation, and anomaly detection.

**Why is GMM better than K means ?**

> K-means assigns each data point to one cluster, while GMM assigns points to multiple clusters with probabilities. GMM can handle elliptical shapes, unlike K-means, which only detects spherical clusters. This makes GMM more flexible for complex data

**How does GMM handle overlapping clusters?**

> GMM can handle overlapping clusters by assigning probabilities to data points, allowing them to belong to more than one cluster. This is useful when clusters have varying densities or are not well-separate.
