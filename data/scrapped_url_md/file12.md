![Best-Python-libraries-for-Machine-Learning](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241016111624309123/Best-Python-libraries-for-Machine-Learning.webp)

Best Python libraries for Machine Learning

In this article, we’ll dive into the _**Best Python libraries for Machine Learning**_, exploring how they facilitate various tasks like data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. Whether you are a beginner just getting started or a professional looking to optimize workflows, these libraries will help you leverage the full potential of Machine Learning with Python.

## **Python libraries for Machine Learning**

Here’s a list of some of the **best Python libraries for Machine Learning** that streamline development:

### 1\. Numpy

NumPy is a very popular python library for large multi-dimensional array and matrix processing, with the help of a large collection of high-level mathematical functions. It is very useful for fundamental scientific computations in [Machine Learning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/). It is particularly useful for linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities. High-end libraries like TensorFlow uses [NumPy](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-numpy/) internally for manipulation of Tensors.

**Example:** Linear Algebra Operations

Python`
import numpy as np
# Create a feature matrix (X) and target vector (y)
X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
y = np.array([1, 2, 3])
# Calculate the mean of each feature
mean = np.mean(X, axis=0)
print("Mean of features:", mean)
`

**Output:**

```
Mean of features: [3. 4.]
```

### 2\. Pandas

Pandas is a popular Python library for [data analysis](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-data-analysis/). It is not directly related to Machine Learning. As we know that the dataset must be prepared before training.

- In this case, [Pandas](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pandas-tutorial/) comes handy as it was developed specifically for data extraction and preparation.
- It provides high-level data structures and wide variety tools for data analysis. It provides many inbuilt methods for grouping, combining and filtering data.

**Example:** Data Cleaning and Preparation

Python`
import pandas as pd
# Create a DataFrame with missing values
data = {
    'Country': ['Brazil', 'Russia', 'India', None],
    'Population': [200.4, 143.5, None, 52.98]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
# Fill missing values
df['Population'].fillna(df['Population'].mean(), inplace=True)
print(df)
`

**Output:**

```
   Country  Population
0   Brazil       200.40
1    Russia       143.50
2    India       132.99
 3    None        52.98
```

### 3\. Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a very popular Python library for [data visualization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-visualization-and-its-importance/). Like Pandas, it is not directly related to Machine Learning. It particularly comes in handy when a programmer wants to visualize the patterns in the data. It is a 2D plotting library used for creating 2D graphs and plots.

- A module named pyplot makes it easy for programmers for plotting as it provides features to control line styles, font properties, formatting axes, etc.
- It provides various kinds of graphs and plots for data visualization, viz., histogram, error charts, bar chats, etc,

**Example**: Creating a linear Plot

Python`
#  Python program using Matplotlib
# for forming a linear plot
# importing the necessary packages and modules
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
# Prepare the data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
# Plot the data
plt.plot(x, x, label ='linear')
# Add a legend
plt.legend()
# Show the plot
plt.show()
`

**Output:**

![linear-3](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241016172139231244/linear-3.png)

Output

### 4\. SciPy

SciPy is a very popular library among Machine Learning enthusiasts as it contains different modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration and statistics. There is a difference between the [SciPy](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scipy-linear-algebra-scipy-linalg/) library and the SciPy stack. The SciPy is one of the core packages that make up the SciPy stack. SciPy is also very useful for image manipulation.

**Example:** Image Manipulation

Python`
# Python script using Scipy
# for image manipulation
from scipy.misc import imread, imsave, imresize
# Read a JPEG image into a numpy array
img = imread('D:/Programs / cat.jpg') # path of the image
print(img.dtype, img.shape)
# Tinting the image
img_tint = img * [1, 0.45, 0.3]
# Saving the tinted image
imsave('D:/Programs / cat_tinted.jpg', img_tint)
# Resizing the tinted image to be 300 x 300 pixels
img_tint_resize = imresize(img_tint, (300, 300))
# Saving the resized tinted image
imsave('D:/Programs / cat_tinted_resized.jpg', img_tint_resize)
`

> If scipy.misc import imread, imsave,imresize does not work on your operating system then try below code instead to proceed with above code

```
!pip install imageio
import imageio
from imageio import imread, imsave
```

**Original image:**

### 5\. Scikit-Learn

Scikit-learn is one of the most popular ML libraries for classical [ML algorithms.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning-algorithms/) It is built on top of two basic Python libraries, viz., NumPy and SciPy. Scikit-learn supports most of the supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. Scikit-learn can also be used for data-mining and data-analysis, which makes it a great tool who is starting out with ML.

**Example**: Decision Tree Classifier

Python`
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
# Load the iris dataset
iris = datasets.load_iris()
# Split the dataset into features (X) and target labels (y)
X = iris.data   # Features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width)
y = iris.target # Target (species)
# Initialize the Decision Tree Classifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
# Train the model on the entire dataset
clf.fit(X, y)
# Make predictions on the same dataset
predictions = clf.predict(X)
# Print the first 10 predictions
print("Predicted labels for the first 10 samples:", predictions[:10])
# Print the actual labels for comparison
print("Actual labels for the first 10 samples:", y[:10])
`

**Output:**

```
Predicted labels for the first 10 samples: [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
Actual labels for the first 10 samples: [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
```

### 6\. Theano

We all know that Machine Learning is basically mathematics and statistics. [Theano](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/theano-in-python/) is a popular python library that is used to define, evaluate and optimize mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays in an efficient manner.

- It is achieved by optimizing the utilization of CPU and GPU. It is extensively used for unit-testing and self-verification to detect and diagnose different types of errors.
- Theano is a very powerful library that has been used in large-scale computationally intensive scientific projects for a long time but is simple and approachable enough to be used by individuals for their own projects.

**Example**

Python`
# Python program using Theano
# for computing a Logistic
# Function
import theano
import theano.tensor as T
x = T.dmatrix('x')
s = 1 / (1 + T.exp(-x))
logistic = theano.function([x], s)
logistic([[0, 1], [-1, -2]])
`

**Output:**

```
array([[0.5, 0.73105858],\
       [0.26894142, 0.11920292]])
```

### 7\. TensorFlow

TensorFlow is a very popular open-source library for high performance numerical computation developed by the Google Brain team in Google. As the name suggests, Tensorflow is a framework that involves defining and running computations involving tensors. It can train and run deep neural networks that can be used to develop several AI applications. [TensorFlow](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-tensorflow/) is widely used in the field of deep learning research and application.

**Example**

Python``
#  Python program using TensorFlow
#  for multiplying two arrays
# import `tensorflow`
import tensorflow as tf
# Initialize two constants
x1 = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4])
x2 = tf.constant([5, 6, 7, 8])
# Multiply
result = tf.multiply(x1, x2)
# Initialize the Session
sess = tf.Session()
# Print the result
print(sess.run(result))
# Close the session
sess.close()
``

**Output:**

```
[ 5 12 21 32]
```

### 8\. Keras

Keras is a very popular _**Python Libaries for Machine Learning**_. It is a high-level neural networks API capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It can run seamlessly on both CPU and GPU. Keras makes it really for ML beginners to build and design a [Neural Network](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/neural-networks-a-beginners-guide/). One of the best thing about Keras is that it allows for easy and fast prototyping.

**Example**

Python`
# Importing necessary libraries
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Flatten
from keras.datasets import mnist
from keras.utils import to_categorical
# Loading the MNIST dataset
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
# Normalizing the input data
X_train = X_train / 255.0
X_test = X_test / 255.0
# One-hot encoding the labels
y_train = to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test = to_categorical(y_test, 10)
# Building the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)))  # Flatten the 2D images into 1D vectors
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))  # Hidden layer with ReLU activation
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))  # Output layer with Softmax for classification
# Compiling the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
# Training the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
# Evaluating the model
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy:.4f}")
`

**Output:**

```
Epoch 1/5
1500/1500 [==============================] - 4s 2ms/step - loss: 0.2941 - accuracy: 0.9163 - val_loss: 0.1372 - val_accuracy: 0.9615
Epoch 2/5
1500/1500 [==============================] - 3s 2ms/step - loss: 0.1236 - accuracy: 0.9647 - val_loss: 0.1056 - val_accuracy: 0.9697
...

# H is hidden dimension; D_out is output dimension.
N, D_in, H, D_out = 64, 1000, 100, 10
# Create random input and output data
x = torch.random(N, D_in, device=device, dtype=dtype)
y = torch.random(N, D_out, device=device, dtype=dtype)
# Randomly initialize weights
w1 = torch.random(D_in, H, device=device, dtype=dtype)
w2 = torch.random(H, D_out, device=device, dtype=dtype)
learning_rate = 1e-6
for t in range(500):
    # Forward pass: compute predicted y
    h = x.mm(w1)
    h_relu = h.clamp(min=0)
    y_pred = h_relu.mm(w2)
    # Compute and print loss
    loss = (y_pred - y).pow(2).sum().item()
    print(t, loss)
    # Backprop to compute gradients of w1 and w2 with respect to loss
    grad_y_pred = 2.0 * (y_pred - y)
    grad_w2 = h_relu.t().mm(grad_y_pred)
    grad_h_relu = grad_y_pred.mm(w2.t())
    grad_h = grad_h_relu.clone()
    grad_h[h < 0] = 0
    grad_w1 = x.t().mm(grad_h)
    # Update weights using gradient descent
    w1 -= learning_rate * grad_w1
    w2 -= learning_rate * grad_w2
`

**Output:**
