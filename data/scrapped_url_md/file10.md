Report

In the realm of machine learning, data is the fuel that powers innovation. The quality and quantity of data directly influence the performance and capabilities of machine learning models. Open datasets, in particular, play an important role in democratizing access to data and fostering collaboration and innovation within machine learning.

![Top-Machine-Learning-Dataset-(2)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240326164905/Top-Machine-Learning-Dataset-(2).png)Machine Learning Dataset

In this article we will explore about the _**What are ML Datasets, Types of ML Datasets, and uncovering some of the Top Resources available to Machine Learning Datasets.**_

## What are ML datasets?

The [Machine Learning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/)(ML) datasets are defined by the collection of data that can be used to train, test, and evaluate the model. This type of dataset makes programmers learn machine learning algorithms and execute the practical implementation of prediction.

The ML dataset was collected through various domains such as [image recognition](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-image-recognition/), [text preprocessing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/text-preprocessing-in-python-set-1/), and sound or [speech recognition](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/speech-recognition-in-python-using-cmu-sphinx/). On the internet, few resources are easily available for anyone to use, while other datasets are based on project recommendations.

## Types of ML Datasets

The dataset of ML performs the specific problem where the model is being trained and finds the solution to it. There are three different ways to categorize the dataset-

1. **Training Dataset:** This type of data is used to train the model in Machine Learning.
2. **Validation Dataset:** This type of dataset is optimized during the time of model training and it helps to prevent overfitting.
3. **Testing Dataset:** The testing dataset is not used during the time of training or validation and it is also termed a reserved dataset which can be used to evaluate the unseen data or model performance.

All the above categories of datasets play an important practice in the field of machine learning. Ensure that the model is trained and evaluated in an unbiased manner.

## Top Resources of Machine Learning Dataset

Now we will know the top resources of Machine Learning from where we will take datasets for our project requirement. Below is the list of ML resources with their links-

### UCI Machine Learning Repository

This is the ML community that was first created by a researcher at the University of Irvine, California, and distributes various datasets that cover diverse domains. In addition to this, the datasets are available in various formats with detailed documentation that helps the ML audience to understand the data well. So, it is a valuable resource for both beginner and experienced users in the field.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we first looked at the definition of Machine Learning Datasets and also discussed their types of datasets such as training, validation, and testing. Then we saw a list of ML datasets resources with drive links where we found some specific information. In the list of datasets, we observed two big companies i.e. [Microsoft](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/microsoft-azure/) and [NASA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-does-nasa-use-machine-learning/) provide the datasets to both public and private organizations. Therefore, every industries scale the new height by entering into the power of data.
