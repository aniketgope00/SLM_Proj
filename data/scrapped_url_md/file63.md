Report

[Naive Bayes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/naive-bayes-classifiers/) is a probabilistic machine learning algorithms based on the **Bayes Theorem.** It is a simple yet powerful algorithm because of its understanding, simplicity and ease of implementation. It is popular method for classification applications such as spam filtering and text classification. In this article we will learn about Naive Bayes Classifier From Scratch in Python.

## Naive Bayes Scratch Implementation using Python

Here we are implementing a Naive Bayes Algorithm using Gaussian distributions. It performs all the necessary steps from data preparation and model training to testing and evaluation.

#### 1\. Importing Libraries

Importing necessary libraries:

- `math`: for mathematical operations
- `random`: for random number generation
- `pandas`: for data manipulation
- `numpy`: for scientific computing

Python`
import math
import random
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
`

#### 2\. Encode Class

The `encode_class` function converts class labels in the dataset into numeric values. It assigns a unique numeric identifier to each class.

Python`
def encode_class(mydata):
    classes = []
    for i in range(len(mydata)):
        if mydata[i][-1] not in classes:
            classes.append(mydata[i][-1])
    for i in range(len(classes)):
        for j in range(len(mydata)):
            if mydata[j][-1] == classes[i]:
                mydata[j][-1] = i
    return mydata
`

#### 3\. Data Splitting

The `splitting` function is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets based on the given ratio.

Python`
def splitting(mydata, ratio):
    train_num = int(len(mydata) * ratio)
    train = []
    test = list(mydata)
    while len(train) < train_num:
        index = random.randrange(len(test))
        train.append(test.pop(index))
    return train, test
`

#### 4\. Group Data by Class

The `groupUnderClass` function takes the data and returns a dictionary where each key is a class label and the value is a list of data points belonging to that class.

Python`
def groupUnderClass(mydata):
    data_dict = {}
    for i in range(len(mydata)):
        if mydata[i][-1] not in data_dict:
            data_dict[mydata[i][-1]] = []
        data_dict[mydata[i][-1]].append(mydata[i])
    return data_dict
`

#### **5\. Calculate Mean and Standard Deviation for Class**

The `MeanAndStdDev` function takes a list of numbers and calculates the mean and standard deviation.

The `MeanAndStdDevForClass` function takes the data and returns a dictionary where each key is a class label and the value is a list of lists, where each inner list contains the mean and standard deviation for each attribute of the class.

Python`
def MeanAndStdDev(numbers):
    avg = np.mean(numbers)
    stddev = np.std(numbers)
    return avg, stddev
def MeanAndStdDevForClass(mydata):
    info = {}
    data_dict = groupUnderClass(mydata)
    for classValue, instances in data_dict.items():
        info[classValue] = [MeanAndStdDev(attribute) for attribute in zip(*instances)]
    return info
`

#### **6\. Calculate Gaussian and Class Probabilities**

- The `calculateGaussianProbability` function takes a value, mean, and standard deviation and calculates the probability of the value occurring under a Gaussian distribution with that mean and standard deviation.
- The `calculateClassProbabilities` function takes the information dictionary and a test data point as arguments. It iterates through each class and calculates the probability of the test data point belonging to that class based on the mean and standard deviation of each attribute for that class.

Python`
def calculateGaussianProbability(x, mean, stdev):
    epsilon = 1e-10
    expo = math.exp(-(math.pow(x - mean, 2) / (2 * math.pow(stdev + epsilon, 2))))
    return (1 / (math.sqrt(2 * math.pi) * (stdev + epsilon))) * expo
def calculateClassProbabilities(info, test):
    probabilities = {}
    for classValue, classSummaries in info.items():
        probabilities[classValue] = 1
        for i in range(len(classSummaries)):
            mean, std_dev = classSummaries[i]
            x = test[i]
            probabilities[classValue] *= calculateGaussianProbability(x, mean, std_dev)
    return probabilities
`

#### **7\. Prediction for Test Set**

- The `predict` function takes the information dictionary and a test data point as arguments. It calculates the class probabilities and returns the class with the highest probability.
- The `getPredictions` function takes the information dictionary and the test set as arguments. It iterates through each test data point and predicts its class using the `predict` function.

Python`
def predict(info, test):
    probabilities = calculateClassProbabilities(info, test)
    bestLabel = max(probabilities, key=probabilities.get)
    return bestLabel
def getPredictions(info, test):
    predictions = [predict(info, instance) for instance in test]
    return predictions
`

#### **8\. Calculate Accuracy**

The `accuracy_rate` function takes the test set and the predictions as arguments. It compares the predicted classes with the actual classes and calculates the percentage of correctly predicted data points.

Python`
def accuracy_rate(test, predictions):
    correct = sum(1 for i in range(len(test)) if test[i][-1] == predictions[i])
    return (correct / float(len(test))) * 100.0

`

#### **9\. Load and Preprocess Data**

The code then loads the data from a CSV file using pandas and converts it into a list of lists. It then encodes the class labels and converts all attributes to floating-point numbers. Dataset we are using is of diabetes patients and can be downloaded form [here](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250126213253766614/pima-indians-diabetes.csv).

Python`
# Load data using pandas
filename = '/content/diabetes_data.csv'  # Add the correct file path
df = pd.read_csv(filename)
mydata = df.values.tolist()
# Encode classes and convert attributes to float
mydata = encode_class(mydata)
for i in range(len(mydata)):
    for j in range(len(mydata[i]) - 1):
        mydata[i][j] = float(mydata[i][j])
`

#### **10\. Split Data into Training and Testing Sets**

The code splits the data into training and testing sets using a specified ratio. It then trains the model by calculating the mean and standard deviation for each attribute in each class.

Python`
# Split the data into training and testing sets
ratio = 0.7
train_data, test_data = splitting(mydata, ratio)
print('Total number of examples:', len(mydata))
print('Training examples:', len(train_data))
print('Test examples:', len(test_data))
`

**Output:**

```
Total number of examples: 768
Training examples: 537
Test examples: 231
```

#### **11\. Train and Test the Model**

Calculate mean and standard deviation for each attribute within each class for the training set. Finally, it tests the model on the test set and calculates the accuracy.

Python`
# Train the model
info = MeanAndStdDevForClass(train_data)
# Test the model
predictions = getPredictions(info, test_data)
accuracy = accuracy_rate(test_data, predictions)
print('Accuracy of the model:', accuracy)
`

**Output:**

```
Accuracy of the model: 100.0
```

Naive Bayes proves to be an efficient and simple algorithm that works well for classification tasks. It is easy to understand since it is based on Bayes’ theorem and is simple to use and analyze. **Naive Bayes Algorithm** implementation from scratch in Python can be used to get insights and precise predictions for a variety of applications like spam filtering and text classification.
