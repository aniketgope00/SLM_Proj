[GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generative-adversarial-network-gan/) are deep learning models that create and modify images using two networks: a **generator** which creates images and a **discriminator** which checks if they look real. However traditional GANs require **matching image pairs** for training which is not always available.

CycleGAN solves this problem by allowing image-to-image translation **without paired images**. It learns the features of the target style and transforms images from the original style to match it. This makes it useful for tasks like changing seasons in photos, converting animals or turning pictures into paintings.

## **Understanding Cycle GAN**

Imagine you learn a new word in a foreign language, and then you translate it back to your native language to see if it still means the same thing. If the translation matches the original word then you’ve learned the translation correctly. If it doesn’t it means the translation process is flawed and you need to correct it.

This concept works similarly in CycleGAN. When an image is passed through the generator to be translated into another domain (e.g from a photo to a painting) CycleGAN applies the cycle consistency loss to ensure that when the image is passed through the reverse generator (from the painting back to the photo) it should resemble the original image closely. If the transformation is accurate the system has learned the mapping between the two domains properly.

### How CycleGAN Work

For example:

1. **Original Image** (Photo) → **Generator G** → Transformed Image (Painting)
2. **Transformed Image** (Painting) → **Generator F** → **Reconstructed Image** (Photo)

In CycleGAN we treat the problem as an image reconstruction problem. We first take an image input (x) and using the generator G to convert into the reconstructed image. Then we reverse this process from reconstructed image to original image using a generator F. Then we calculate the mean squared error loss between real and reconstructed image.

The most important feature of this cycle GAN is that it can do this image translation on an unpaired image where there is no relation exists between the input image and output image.

### **Architecture of CycleGAN**

CycleGAN has two main parts: **Generator** and **Discriminator** just like other GANs.

- The **Generator’s job** is to create images that look like they belong to a certain style or category.
- The **Discriminator’s job** is to figure out if the image is real (from the original style) or fake (created by the Generator).

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200529210740/cycleconsistencyandlosses.PNG)

**Generators**:

CycleGAN has two generators—G and F.

- G transforms images from domain X (e.g., photos) to domain Y (e.g., artwork).
- F transforms images from domain Y back to domain X.

The generator mapping functions are as follows:

G:X→YF:Y→X\\begin{array}{l} G : X \\rightarrow Y \\\ F : Y \\rightarrow X \\end{array}   G:X→YF:Y→X​

where X is the input image distribution and Y is the desired output distribution (such as Van Gogh styles) .

**Discriminators**:

There are two discriminators—Dₓ and Dᵧ.

- Dₓ distinguishes between real images from X and generated images from F(y).
- Dᵧ distinguishes between real images from Y and generated images from G(x)

To further regularize the mappings the CycleGAN uses two more loss function in addition to adversarial loss.

**Forward Cycle Consistency Loss**: Ensures that when you apply **G** and then **F** to an image you get back the original image

For example: .x–>G(x)–>F(G(x))≈xx –> G(x) –>F(G(x)) \\approx x x–>G(x)–>F(G(x))≈x

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200605220847/202006041.jpg)

**Backward Cycle Consistency Loss**: Ensures that when you apply **F** and then **G** to an image, you get back the original image.

y–>F(y)–>G(F(y))≈yy–> F(y) –>G(F(y)) \\approx y   y–>F(y)–>G(F(y))≈y

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200605221027/20200604.jpg)![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200529210741/inputoutputresconstrcuted.PNG)

### **Generator Architecture**

Each CycleGAN generator has three main sections:

1. **Encoder** – The input image is passed through three convolution layers which extract features and compress the image while increasing the number of channels. For example a 256×256×3 image is reduced to 64×64×256 after this step.
2. **Transformer** – The encoded image is processed through 6 or 9 residual blocks depending on the input size, which helps retain important image details.
3. **Decoder** – The transformed image is upsampled using two deconvolution layers and restoring it to its original size.

**Generator Structure:**

**c7s1-64 → d128 → d256 → R256 (×6 or 9) → u128 → u64 → c7s1-3**

- **c7s1-k**: 7×7 convolution layer with k filters.
- **dk**: 3×3 convolution with stride 2 (downsampling).
- **Rk**: Residual block with two 3×3 convolutions.
- **uk**: Fractional-stride deconvolution (upsampling).

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200605220659/generator.jpg)

### **Discriminator Architecture (PatchGAN)**

In discriminator the authors use PatchGAN discriminator. The difference between a PatchGAN and regular GAN discriminator is that rather the regular GAN maps from a 256×256 image to a single scalar output, which signifies “real” or “fake”, whereas the PatchGAN maps from 256×256 to an NxN (here 70×70) array of outputs X, where each Xij signifies whether the patch _ij_ in the image is real or fake.

**Discriminator Structure:**

**C64 → C128 → C256 → C512 → Final Convolution**

- **Ck**: 4×4 convolution with k filters, InstanceNormand LeakyReLU except the first layer.
- The final layer produces a **1×1 output and** marking real vs. fake patches.

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200605220731/Discriminator.jpg)

## Cost Function in CycleGAN

CycleGAN uses a **cost function** or loss function to guide the training process. The cost function is made up of several parts:

- **Adversarial Loss:** We apply adversarial loss to both our mappings of generators and discriminators. This adversary loss is written as :

Lossadvers(G,Dy,X,Y)=1m∑(1–Dy(G(x)))2Loss\_{advers}\\left ( G, D\_y, X, Y \\right ) =\\frac{1}{m}\\sum \\left ( 1 – D\_y\\left ( G\\left ( x \\right ) \\right ) \\right )^{2} \\,   Lossadvers​(G,Dy​,X,Y)=m1​∑(1–Dy​(G(x)))2

Lossadvers(F,Dx,Y,X)=1m∑(1–Dx(F(y)))2Loss\_{advers}\\left ( F, D\_x, Y, X \\right ) =\\frac{1}{m}\\sum \\left ( 1 – D\_x\\left ( F\\left ( y \\right ) \\right ) \\right )^{2}   Lossadvers​(F,Dx​,Y,X)=m1​∑(1–Dx​(F(y)))2

- **Cycle Consistency Loss**: Given a random set of images adversarial network can map the set of input image to random permutation of images in the output domain which may induce the output distribution similar to target distribution. Thus adversarial mapping cannot guarantee the input xi  to yi . For this to happen the author proposed that process should be cycle-consistent. This loss function used in Cycle GAN to measure the error rate of  inverse mapping G(x) -> F(G(x)). The behavior induced by this loss function cause closely matching the real input (x) and F(G(x))

Losscyc(G,F,X,Y)=1m\[(F(G(xi))−xi)+(G(F(yi))−yi)\]Loss\_{cyc}\\left ( G, F, X, Y \\right ) =\\frac{1}{m}\\left \[ \\left ( F\\left ( G\\left ( x\_i \\right ) \\right )-x\_i \\right ) +\\left ( G\\left ( F\\left ( y\_i \\right ) \\right )-y\_i \\right ) \\right \]   Losscyc​(G,F,X,Y)=m1​\[(F(G(xi​))−xi​)+(G(F(yi​))−yi​)\]

The Cost function we used is the sum of adversarial loss and cyclic consistent loss:

L(G,F,Dx,Dy)=Ladvers(G,Dy,X,Y)+Ladvers(F,Dx,Y,X)+λLcycl(G,F,X,Y)L\\left ( G, F, D\_x, D\_y \\right ) = L\_{advers}\\left (G, D\_y, X, Y \\right ) + L\_{advers}\\left (F, D\_x, Y, X \\right ) + \\lambda L\_{cycl}\\left ( G, F, X, Y \\right )   L(G,F,Dx​,Dy​)=Ladvers​(G,Dy​,X,Y)+Ladvers​(F,Dx​,Y,X)+λLcycl​(G,F,X,Y)

and our aim is :

argminG,FmaxDx,DyL(G,F,Dx,Dy)arg \\underset{G, F}{min}\\underset{D\_x, D\_y}{max}L\\left ( G, F, D\_x, D\_y \\right )   argG,Fmin​Dx​,Dy​max​L(G,F,Dx​,Dy​)

## Applications of CycleGAN in Image Translation

**1\. Collection Style Transfer:** CycleGAN can learn to mimic the style of entire collections of artworks (e.g., Van Gogh, Monet, or Cezanne) rather than just transferring the style of a single image. Therefore it can generate different  styles such as : Van Gogh, Cezanne, Monet, and Ukiyo-e. This capability makes CycleGAN particularly useful for generating diverse artwork.

Comparison of different Style Transfer Results

**2\. Object Transformation**: CycleGAN can transform objects between different classes, such as turning zebras into horses, apples into oranges, or vice versa. This is especially useful for creative industries and content generation.

- **Apple <—> Oranges:**

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200529230839/orangestoapples-660x214.PNG)

**3\. Seasonal Transfer**: CycleGAN can be used for seasonal image transformation, such as converting winter photos to summer scenes and vice versa. For instance, it was trained on photos of Yosemite in both winter and summer to enable this transformation.

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200529232317/wintersummertransformation-660x250.PNG)

**4\. Photo Generation from Paintings**: CycleGAN can transform a painting into a photo, and vice versa. This is useful for artistic applications where you want to blend the look of photos with artistic styles. This loss can be defined as :

Lidentity(G,F)=Eyp(y)\[∥G(y)−y∥1\]+Exp(x)\[∥F(x)−x∥1\]L\_{identity}\\left ( G, F \\right ) =\\mathbb{E}\_{y~p\\left ( y \\right )}\\left \[ \\left \\\| G(y)-y \\right \\\|\_1 \\right \] + \\mathbb{E}\_{x~p\\left ( x \\right )}\\left \[ \\left \\\| F(x)-x \\right \\\|\_1 \\right \]Lidentity​(G,F)=Eyp(y)​\[∥G(y)−y∥1​\]+Exp(x)​\[∥F(x)−x∥1​\]

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200529232535/photogenration.PNG)

**5\. Photo Enhancement**: CycleGAN can enhance photos taken with smartphone cameras (which typically have a deeper depth of field) to look like those taken with DSLR cameras (which have a shallower depth of field). This application is valuable for image quality improvement.

## Evaluating CycleGAN’s Performance

- **AMT Perceptual Studies**: It involve real people reviewing generated images to see if they look real. This is like a voting system where participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk compare AI-created images with actual ones.
- **FCN Scores**: It help to measure accuracy especially in datasets like Cityscapes. These scores check how well the AI understands objects in images by evaluating **pixel accuracy** and **IoU (Intersection over Union)** which measures how well the shapes of objects match real.

## **Drawbacks and Limitations**

- CycleGAN is great at modifying textures like turning a horse’s coat into zebra stripes but cannot significantly change object shapes or structures.
- The model is trained to change colors and patterns rather than reshaping objects and make structural modifications difficult.
- Sometimes it give the unpredictable results like the generated images may look unnatural or contain distortions.
