\\
\\
In the wider community of neurologists and those who are researching the brain, It is agreed that two temporarily distinct processes contribute to the acquisition and expression of brain functions. These variations can result in long-lasting alterations in neuron operations, for instance through act\\

- [What is LSTM - Long Short Term Memory?\\
\\
\\
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is an enhanced version of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber. LSTMs can capture long-term dependencies in sequential data making them ideal for tasks like language translation, speech recognition and time series forecasting. Unli\\

- [Long Short Term Memory Networks Explanation\\
\\
\\
Prerequisites: Recurrent Neural Networks To solve the problem of Vanishing and Exploding Gradients in a Deep Recurrent Neural Network, many variations were developed. One of the most famous of them is the Long Short Term Memory Network(LSTM). In concept, an LSTM recurrent unit tries to "remember" al\\

- [LSTM - Derivation of Back propagation through time\\
\\
\\
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are a type of neural network designed to handle long-term dependencies by handling the vanishing gradient problem. One of the fundamental techniques used to train LSTMs is Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) where we have sequential data. In this article we summarize ho\\

- [Text Generation using Recurrent Long Short Term Memory Network\\
\\
\\
LSTMs are a type of neural network that are well-suited for tasks involving sequential data such as text generation. They are particularly useful because they can remember long-term dependencies in the data which is crucial when dealing with text that often has context that spans over multiple words\\
