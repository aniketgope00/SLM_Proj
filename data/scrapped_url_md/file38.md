# Gradient Descent in Linear Regression

**Gradient descent is a optimization algorithm used in linear regression to minimize the error in predictions**. This article explores how gradient descent works in linear regression.

## Why Gradient Descent in Linear Regression?

[Linear regression](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-linear-regression/) involves finding the **best-fit line** for a dataset by minimizing the **error** between the actual and predicted values. This error is measured using the **cost function**, **typically the Mean Squared Error (MSE).** The goal is to find the model parameters (slope m and intercept b) that minimize this cost function.

For simple linear regression, we can use formulas (like [Normal Equation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-normal-equation-in-linear-regression/)) to compute parameters directly. However, for **large datasets** or **high-dimensional data**, these methods become computationally expensive or even infeasible due to:

- Large matrix computations.
- Memory limitations.

In models like [polynomial regression](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-implementation-of-polynomial-regression/) cost function becomes highly complex and non-linear. Analytical solutions are not available. **That’s where gradient descent plays an important role, it** is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function by iteratively updating the model parameters. It works well even for:

- Large datasets.
- Complex, high-dimensional problems.

## **How Does Gradient Descent Work in Linear Regression?**

**1\. Initialize Parameters**: Start with random initial values for the slope (\[Tex\]m\[/Tex\]) and intercept (\[Tex\]b\[/Tex\]).

**2\. Calculate the Cost Function**: Compute the error using a cost function such as [Mean Squared Error (MSE)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mean-squared-error/):

\[Tex\]J(m, b) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum\_{i=1}^{n} \\left( y\_i – (mx\_i + b) \\right)^2\[/Tex\]

**3\. Compute the Gradient**: Find the gradient of the cost function with respect to m and b. These gradients indicate how the cost changes when the parameters are adjusted.

For \[Tex\]m\[/Tex\] (slope): \[Tex\]\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial m} = -\\frac{2}{n} \\sum\_{i=1}^{n} x\_i (y\_i – (mx\_i + b))\[/Tex\]

For \[Tex\]b\[/Tex\] (intercept): \[Tex\]\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial b} = -\\frac{2}{n} \\sum\_{i=1}^{n} (y\_i – (mx\_i + b))\[/Tex\]

**4\. Update Parameters**: Adjust \[Tex\]m\[/Tex\] and \[Tex\]b\[/Tex\] in the direction that reduces the cost:

For \[Tex\]m\[/Tex\] (slope): \[Tex\]m = m – \\alpha \\cdot \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial m}\[/Tex\]

For \[Tex\]b\[/Tex\] (intercept): \[Tex\]b = b – \\alpha \\cdot \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial b}\[/Tex\]

**5\. Repeat**: Iterate until the cost function converges i.e further updates make little or no difference.

## Python Implementation

Lets implement it, but too see results of gradient descent optimization we will first implement linear regression model without it.

Python`
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
# Generate synthetic regression dataset
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=1, noise=15, random_state=42)
y = y.reshape(-1, 1)
m = X.shape[0]
X_b = np.c_[np.ones((m, 1)), X]
theta = np.array([[2.0], [3.0]])
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.scatter(X, y, color="blue", label="Actual Data")
plt.plot(X, X_b.dot(theta), color="green", label="Initial Line (No GD)")
plt.xlabel("Feature")
plt.ylabel("Target")
plt.title("Linear Regression Without Gradient Descent")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
`

**Output:**

Linear Regression without Gradient Descent

Here we can see that model is not making accurate predictions, and the line is not fitting the data properly. This is due to suboptimal parameter initialization. It prevents the algorithm from converging to the best-fit line.

Now, we will use gradient descent in this model to optimize it.

Python`
learning_rate = 0.1
n_iterations = 100
# Performing Gradient Descent
for _ in range(n_iterations):
    # Predictions
    y_pred = X_b.dot(theta)
    # Computing the gradient
    gradients = (2 / m) * X_b.T.dot(y_pred - y)
    # Updating parameters
    theta -= learning_rate * gradients
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.scatter(X, y, color="blue", label="Actual Data")
plt.plot(X, X_b.dot(theta), color="red", label="Optimized Line (With GD)")
plt.xlabel("Feature")
plt.ylabel("Target")
plt.title("Linear Regression With Gradient Descent")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
`

**Output:**

Linear Regression with Gradient Descent shows how the model learns to fit the line that minimizes the error between the predicted and actual values. By iteratively updating the parameters.

Linear Regression with Gradient Descent is a simple optimization method that adjusts model parameters to find the best-fit line for given data. By iteratively minimizing the cost function, gradient descent ensures the line accurately represents the relationship between variables. With proper parameter tuning gradient descent gives reliable and accurate predictions for a wide range of applications.
