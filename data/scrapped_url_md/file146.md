Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that gives the ability to machine understand and process human languages. Human languages can be in the form of text or audio format.

## Applications of NLP

The applications of Natural Language Processing are as follows:

- Voice Assistants like Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant use NLP for voice recognition and interaction.
- Tools like Grammarly, Microsoft Word, and Google Docs apply NLP for grammar checking and text analysis.
- Information extraction through Search engines such as Google and DuckDuckGo.
- Website bots and customer support chatbots leverage NLP for automated conversations and query handling.
- Google Translate and similar services use NLP for real-time translation between languages.
- Text summarization

This NLP tutorial is designed for both beginners and professionals. Whether you are a beginner or a data scientist, this guide will provide you with the knowledge and skills you need to take your understanding of NLP to the next level.

### Phases of Natural Language Processing

![Phases of Natural Language Processing](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230301155815/Phases-of-Natural-Language-Processing.png)

There are two components of Natural Language Processing:

- Natural Language Understanding

## Normalizing Textual Data in NLP

[**Text Normalization**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/normalizing-textual-data-with-python/) transforms text into a consistent format improves the quality and makes it easier to process in NLP tasks.

Key steps in text normalization includes:

**1\. Regular Expressions (RE)** are sequences of characters that define search patterns.

## History of NLP

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** emerged in 1950 when **Alan Turing** published his groundbreaking paper titled _Computing Machinery and Intelligence_. Turing’s work laid the foundation for **NLP**, which is a subset of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** focused on enabling machines to automatically interpret and generate human language. Over time, NLP technology has evolved, giving rise to different approaches for solving complex language-related tasks.

### 1\. **Heuristic-Based NLP**

The **Heuristic-based approach to NLP** was one of the earliest methods used in natural language processing. It relies on predefined rules and domain-specific knowledge. These rules are typically derived from expert insights. A classic example of this approach is **Regular Expressions (Regex)**, which are used for pattern matching and text manipulation tasks.

### 2\. **Statistical and Machine Learning-Based NLP**

As NLP advanced, **Statistical NLP** emerged, incorporating **machine learning algorithms** to model language patterns. This approach applies statistical rules and learns from data to tackle various language processing tasks. Popular **machine learning algorithms** in this category include:

- [**Naive Bayes**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/naive-bayes-classifiers/)
- [**Support Vector Machines (SVM)**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/support-vector-machine-algorithm/)
- [**Hidden Markov Models (HMM)**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hidden-markov-model-in-machine-learning/)

### 3\. **Neural Network-Based NLP (Deep Learning)**

The most recent advancement in NLP is the adoption of **Deep Learning** techniques. Neural networks, particularly **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, **Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)**, and **Transformers**, have revolutionized NLP tasks by providing superior accuracy. These models require large amounts of data and considerable computational power for training
