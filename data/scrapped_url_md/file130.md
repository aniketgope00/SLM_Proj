In machine learning [Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-recurrent-neural-network/) are essential for tasks involving sequential data such as text, speech and time-series analysis. While traditional RNNs struggle with capturing long-term dependencies due to the **vanishing gradient problem** architectures like [Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deep-learning-introduction-to-long-short-term-memory/) networks were developed to overcome this limitation.

However LSTMs are very complex structure with higher computational cost. To overcome this **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** where introduced which uses LSTM architecture by merging its gating mechanisms offering a more efficient solution for many sequential tasks without sacrificing performance. In this article we’ll learn more about them.

## Getting Started with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)

Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) are a type of RNN introduced by Cho et al. in 2014. The core idea behind GRUs is to use **gating mechanisms** to selectively update the hidden state at each time step allowing them to remember important information while discarding irrelevant details. GRUs aim to simplify the LSTM architecture by merging some of its components and focusing on just two main gates: the **update gate** and the **reset gate**.

### Core Structure of GRUs

![New-Project](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250217170327991817/New-Project.webp)

The GRU consists of **two main gates**:

1. **Update Gate** (\[Tex\]z\_t\[/Tex\]): This gate decides how much information from previous hidden state should be retained for the next time step.
2. **Reset Gate** (\[Tex\]r\_t\[/Tex\]): This gate determines how much of the past hidden state should be forgotten.

These gates allow GRU to control the flow of information in a more efficient manner compared to traditional RNNs which solely rely on hidden state.

### Equations for GRU Operations

The internal workings of a GRU can be described using following equations:

**1\. Reset gate**:

\[Tex\]rt​=σ(Wr​⋅\[ht−1​,xt​\])\[/Tex\]

The reset gate determines how much of the previous hidden state \[Tex\]h\_{t-1}\[/Tex\] should be forgotten.

**2\. Update gate**:

\[Tex\]z\_t = \\sigma(W\_z \\cdot \[h\_{t-1}, x\_t\])\[/Tex\]

The update gate controls how much of the new information \[Tex\]x\_t\[/Tex\]​ should be used to update the hidden state.

![New-Project-](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250217170142375435/New-Project-.webp)

**3\. Candidate hidden state**:

\[Tex\]h\_t’ = \\tanh(W\_h \\cdot \[r\_t \\cdot h\_{t-1}, x\_t\])\[/Tex\]

This is the potential new hidden state calculated based on the current input and the previous hidden state.

**4\. Hidden state**:

\[Tex\]h\_t = (1 – z\_t) \\cdot h\_{t-1} + z\_t \\cdot h\_t'\[/Tex\]

The final hidden state is a weighted average of the previous hidden state \[Tex\]h\_{t-1}\[/Tex\] and the candidate hidden state \[Tex\] h\_t'\[/Tex\] based on the update gate \[Tex\]z\_t\[/Tex\].

## **How GRUs Solve the Vanishing Gradient Problem**

Like LSTMs, GRUs were designed to address the **vanishing gradient problem** which is common in traditional RNNs. GRUs help mitigate this issue by using gates that regulate the flow of gradients during training ensuring that important information is preserved and that gradients do not shrink excessively over time. By using these gates, GRUs maintain a balance between remembering important past information and learning new, relevant data.

### GRU vs LSTM

GRUs are more computationally efficient because they combine the forget and input gates into a single update gate. GRUs do not maintain an internal cell state as LSTMs do, instead they store information directly in the hidden state making them simpler and faster.

| Feature | LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) | GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Gates** | 3 (Input, Forget, Output) | 2 (Update, Reset) |
| **Cell State** | Yes it has cell state | No (Hidden state only) |
| **Training Speed** | Slower due to complexity | Faster due to simpler architecture |
| **Computational Load** | Higher due to more gates and parameters | Lower due to fewer gates and parameters |
| **Performance** | Often better in tasks requiring long-term memory | Performs similarly in many tasks with less complexity |

## Implementation in Python

Now let’s implement simple GRU model in Python using Keras. We’ll start by preparing the necessary libraries and dataset.

### Importing Libraries

Python`
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import GRU, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
`

- **`numpy`**: For handling numerical data and array manipulations.
- **`pandas`**: For data manipulation and reading datasets (CSV files).
- **`MinMaxScaler`**: For normalizing the dataset.
- **`tensorflow.keras.models`** **and** **`tensorflow.keras.layers`**: For building and training the GRU model.
- **`Adam`**: An optimization algorithm used during training.

### 2\. Loading the Dataset

The dataset we’re using is a time-series dataset containing daily temperature data i.e forecasting dataset. It spans 8,000 days starting from January 1, 2010. You can download dataset from [here](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250217163200465278/data.csv).

Python`
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv', parse_dates=['Date'], index_col='Date')
print(df.head())
`

- **`pd.read_csv()`**: Reads a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. Here, we are assuming that the dataset has a ‘Date’ column which is set as the index of the DataFrame.
- **`date_parser=True`**: Ensures that pandas parses the ‘Date’ column as datetime.

**Output:**

> Date Temperature
>
> 2010-01-01 27.483571
>
> 2010-01-02 24.308678
>
> 2010-01-03 28.238443
>
> 2010-01-04 32.615149
>
> 2010-01-05 23.829233

### 3\. Preprocessing the Data

Python`
scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(df.values)
`

- **`MinMaxScaler()`**: This scales the data to a range of 0 to 1. This is important because neural networks perform better when input features are scaled properly.

### 4\. Preparing Data for GRU

Python`
def create_dataset(data, time_step=1):
    X, y = [], []
    for i in range(len(data) - time_step - 1):
        X.append(data[i:(i + time_step), 0])
        y.append(data[i + time_step, 0])
    return np.array(X), np.array(y)
time_step = 100
X, y = create_dataset(scaled_data, time_step)
X = X.reshape(X.shape[0], X.shape[1], 1)
`

- **`create_dataset()`**: Prepares the dataset for time-series forecasting. It creates sliding windows of `time_step` length to predict the next time step.
- **`X.reshape()`**: Reshapes the input data to fit the expected shape for the GRU which is 3D: `[samples, time steps, features]`.

### 5\. Building the GRU Model

Python`
model = Sequential()
model.add(GRU(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(X.shape[1], 1)))
model.add(GRU(units=50))
model.add(Dense(units=1))
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss='mean_squared_error')
`

- **`GRU(units=50)`**: Adds a GRU layer with 50 units (neurons).
- **`return_sequences=True`**: Ensures that the GRU layer returns the entire sequence (required for stacking multiple GRU layers).
- **`Dense(units=1)`**: The output layer which predicts a single value for the next time step.
- **`Adam()`**: An adaptive optimizer commonly used in deep learning.

### 6\. Training the Model

Python`
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
`

- **`model.fit()`**: Trains the model on the prepared dataset. The `epochs=10` specifies the number of iterations over the entire dataset, and `batch_size=32` defines the number of samples per batch.

**Output:**

> Epoch 1/10
>
> 247/247 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 26s 86ms/step – loss: 0.0321
>
> Epoch 2/10
>
> 247/247 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 41s 88ms/step – loss: 0.0178
>
> Epoch 3/10
>
> 247/247 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 22s 89ms/step – loss: 0.0188
>
> Epoch 4/10
>
> 247/247 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 41s 89ms/step – loss: 0.0176
>
> Epoch 5/10
>
> 247/247 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 41s 88ms/step – loss: 0.0181
>
> Epoch 6/10
>
> 247/247 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 42s 91ms/step – loss: 0.0179
>
> Epoch 7/10
>
> 247/247 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 40s 88ms/step – loss: 0.0182
>
> Epoch 8/10
>
> 247/247 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 22s 89ms/step – loss: 0.0180
>
> Epoch 9/10
>
> 247/247 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 22s 88ms/step – loss: 0.0177
>
> Epoch 10/10
>
> 247/247 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 41s 90ms/step – loss: 0.0174

### 7\. Making Predictions

Python`
input_sequence = scaled_data[-time_step:].reshape(1, time_step, 1)
predicted_values = model.predict(input_sequence)
`

- **Input Sequence**: The code takes the **last 100 temperature values** from the dataset ( `scaled_data[-time_step:]`) as an input sequence.
- **Reshaping the Input Sequence**: The input sequence is reshaped into the shape `(1, time_step, 1)` because the GRU model expects a 3D input: `[samples, time_steps, features]`. Here `samples=1` because we are making one prediction, `time_steps=100` (the length of the input sequence) and `features=1` because we are predicting only the temperature value.
- **`model.predict()`**: Uses the trained model to predict future values based on the input data.

**Output:**

> 1/1 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 0s 64ms/step

### 8\. Inverse Transforming the Predictions

Inverse Transforming the Predictions refers to the process of converting the scaled (normalized) predictions back to their original scale.

Python`
predicted_values = scaler.inverse_transform(predicted_values)
print(f"The predicted temperature for the next day is: {predicted_values[0][0]:.2f}°C")
`

- **`scaler.inverse_transform()`**: Converts the normalized predictions back to their original scale.

**Output:**

> The predicted temperature for the next day is: 24.86°C

The output 24.86°C is the GRU model’s prediction for the next day’s temperature based on the past 100 days of data. The model uses historical patterns to forecast future values and converts the prediction back to the original temperature scale.
